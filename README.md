This project focuses on predicting age, gender, and ethnicity from facial images using Python and TensorFlow. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, was preprocessed by normalizing pixel values and split into training and testing sets. I explored the data through visualizations of age, gender, and ethnicity distributions, as well as sample labeled images. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was built with Conv2D, BatchNormalization, MaxPooling, and Dense layers to perform gender prediction, trained with early stopping and evaluated on test data. Results showed good accuracy, and visualizations of training history provided insights into model performance. This project was my first experience with TensorFlow and gave me hands-on practice in deep learning, data preprocessing, and visualization.
